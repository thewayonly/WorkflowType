# WorkflowType

This repository contains about four types of workflow structures that can be used to evaluate scheduling and provisioning algorithms for workflow management systems.

(1) Fast Fourier transform parallel application (FFT), which is cited from [1].
(2) Gaussian elimination parallel application, which is cited from [1].
(3) Scientific workflows,such as Montage, CyberShake, Epigenomics, LIGO Inspiral Analysis and SIPHT, which can be cited from [2].
(4) Randomly generated workflows.
